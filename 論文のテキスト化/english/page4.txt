Traditional voting emphasizes the 
authority of the state. BEV empha
-sizes voter transparency. The BEV 
process is transparent, decentral
-ized, and bottom-up. BEV might not 

perform well in a society whose cul
-ture and values exhibit low compat
-ibility with these values.
27Also, blockchains require much 
energy to perform authentication 
and validation, and they™re slow. 
So, using them for national e-voting 

might not be practical yet.
Finally, BEV will shift power away 
from central actors such as electoral 

authorities and government agen
-cies.
27 Thus, the technology is likely to 
face resistance from political leaders 
 who bene˜t from the status quo.
28Blockchain technology is 

currently in a nascent state. 
There haven™t been enough 
distributed-ledger-technology and 
blockchain-based applications to 

suf˜ciently evaluate whether this 
technology is superior to current 
voting systems.
No full implementation of BEV 
for a national election has occurred 
yet. However, we argue that BEV 
has a future in elections and might 

transform voting.
Political violence related to elec
-tions has been common in Africa 

and other developing countries. BEV 

can ensure security and transparency 
and reduce electoral violence. It can 
also produce more mathematically 

accurate election results. Because 

BEV doesn™t require management 
from a central authority, voting-
related costs will decrease. Finally, 

BEV should reduce the cost of paper-

based elections and increase voter 
participation.
