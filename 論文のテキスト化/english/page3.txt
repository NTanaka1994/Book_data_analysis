one of the accredited observers that 
provided an independent count for 
comparison. Agora described Sierra 
Leone™s elections as a ﬁuse caseﬂ 

rather than a ﬁfull implementationﬂ 

of BEV.
18Finally, Nasdaq has built and 
operated four web-based user inter
-faces for BEV.
15 A BEV system issues 
voting-right assets and voting-token 
assets for each shareholder in a com
-pany. A user can spend voting tokens 
to cast votes on each meeting agenda 

item if that user owns the related 
voting-right asset.
Opportunities and Bene˜ts
BEV provides the following oppor
-tunities and bene˜ts.
To address voter tampering, 
blockchains generate cryptographi
-cally secure voting records. Votes are 
recorded accurately, permanently, se
-curely, and transparently.
5 So, no one 
can modify or manipulate votes.
19 Furthermore, blockchains preserve 
participants™ anonymity while still 
being open to public inspection. Al
-though nothing is totally secure, 

tampering is nearly impossible with 
blockchains.
BEV might promote more voter 
participation. For instance, corpo
-rate annual general meetings can be 

costly events with low shareholder 
participation. With increasing cross-

border investments, companies face 
pressure to increase investor engage
-ment. BEV is a ˚exible solution that 
enables secure, cost-effective voting 

to facilitate shareholder participa
-tion and voting from a distance.
20Also, improved identity veri˜
-cation can help increase access and 
participation. For example, ac
-cording to a federal court in Texas, 
608,470 registered voters lacked ver
-i˜cation identi˜cation.
21 Approxi
-mately 11 percent of US citizens lack 
government-issued photo identi˜ca
-tion cards.
21 BEV can improve this 
situation. For instance, Voatz ac
-cepts 10 different of˜cial documents 

including driver™s licenses, state 

IDs, and passports to verify voter 

identity.
22BEV can increase the speed with 
which votes are tallied. For ex
-ample, Agora reported that it pub
-lished election results on its website 

˜ve days before the of˜cial manual 

counts ended.
16BEV can eliminate ambiguities. 
For example, in the 2017 Virginia 
House of Delegates election, the 
winner was chosen from paper bal
-lots placed in a bowl. One vote ini
-tially wasn™t counted because that 
voter made confusing marks on the 
ballot.
6 Such ambiguity is less likely 
to arise with BEV.
BEV can promote greater trans
-parency and clarity to voters. As of 

2017, 23 countries in had adopted 
 online voting.
23 Current online-voting 
 processes might be complicated for 
some voters. It™s not easy to know 
whether a vote was cast as intended 

or whether it was counted as cast.
23 As we already noted, blockchain 
 results are publicly auditable.
Some security systems in elec
-tronic- and online-voting platforms 

were possibly developed decades ago 
and are vulnerable to tampering.
24 Consider the WINVote touchscreen 

machines made by Advanced Vot
-ing Solutions, which went out of 
business in 2015.
25 WINVote ma
-chines were used in the 2016 US 
elections even though they hadn™t 
had a security patch since April 

2014. A security expert found that 

anyone within a half-mile of a vot
-ing machine could have altered votes 

without detection. Blockchains™ de
-centralized nature makes attacks 

more dif˜cult.
26Finally, with BEV, individual 
votes will be publicly available, while 
voters are masked behind an en
-crypted key. This offers greater pri
-vacy and security than traditional 
ballot boxes and could reduce voter 
suppression. Bad actors can™t iden
-tify voters and therefore can™t target 
them.
3Challenges
Governments and other stakehold
-ers will need to address several 
 major challenges before blockchains 

see widespread use for e-voting. Al
-though blockchains are good at pro
-viding security and accuracy, public 
con˜dence and trust are necessary 
ingredients for BEV™s success. Block
-chains™ complexity might hinder 

mainstream public acceptability of 
BEV.
27 Broadband access and digital 
user skills are also concerns.
In 2016, the nonpro˜t Democ
-racy Earth Foundation used a block
-chain to give Colombian expatriates 
a voice in the 2016 peace plebiscite 
that was conducted to ratify the 
agreement to terminate the con˚ict 

between the Colombian government 

and FARC guerillas.
28 According 
to the foundation, a main challenge 
in the deployment blockchain is the 
technology™s immaturity.
Let™s now consider software qual
-ity. Estimates have suggested that, 
on average, there are from 15 to 
 50 defects per 1,000 LOC.
29  For Ethereum, the blockchain-based 
distributed-computing platform used 
 by Moscow™s Active Citizen pro
-gram (which features smart con
-tracts), the number might be twice 

that. This might be attributed to 
Ethereum™s immaturity. 
The Econo
-mist
 quoted a blogger who said that 
Ethereum contracts are ﬁcandy for 
hackers.ﬂ
