E-Voting
Nir Kshetri and Jeffrey Voas
E-VOTING IS AMONG 
the key pub
-lic sectors that can be disrupted by 
blockchain technology.
1 The idea in 
blockchain-enabled e-voting
 (BEV) 
is simple. To use a digital-currency 
analogy, BEV issues each voter a 

ﬁwalletﬂ containing a user creden
-tial. Each voter gets a single ﬁcoinﬂ 
representing one opportunity to vote. 
 Casting a vote transfers the voter™s 
 coin to a candidate™s wallet. A 
 voter can spend his or her coin only 

once. However, voters can change 
their vote before a preset deadline.
2Here, we argue that blockchains 
might address two of the most prev
-alent concerns in voting today: voter 

access and voter fraud.
The idea is as follows. Eligible vot
-ers cast a ballot anonymously using 
a computer or smartphone. BEV em
-ploys an encrypted key and tamper-
 proof personal IDs. For example, 

the mobile e-voting platform of the 
Boston-based startup Voatz employs 
smart biometrics and real-time ID 

veri˜cation. The public ledger ties 
each cast ballot to an individual 

voter and establishes a permanent, 
immutable record. No bad actor can 
engage in nefarious activities because 

such activities will be evident on the 
ledger or corrected by a peer-to-peer 
consensus network.
3 To compromise 
the network, hackers would need 
 to successfully hack most of the 

blocks (˜les with transaction re
-cords) before new blocks were in
-troduced.
3 The blockchain™s audit 
trail ensures that no vote has been 
changed or removed and that no 
fraudulent and illegitimate votes 

have been added.
4Put simply, blockchains enable 
the creation of tamper-proof audit 
trails for voting. In this article, we 
highlight some BEV implementa
-tions and the approach™s potential 

bene˜ts and challenges.
Recent Examples
Initial operational applications of 

BEV have been for informal, non
-binding, and consultative voting.
5 For 
example, in early 2018, Voatz tested 

its mobile-phone-based system during 
events such as student government 
elections; church-group, nonpro˜t-

organization, and union voting, and 

subnational political-party events.
6 The system has also been used in 
town meetings in Massachusetts.
7As Table 1 shows, blockchain-
based solutions have been deployed 

for corporate, community, city, and 
national voting. For example, in 

Russia, the city of Moscow™s Active 

Citizen program was launched in 
2014 and has more than two million 
users.
8 Each year, Moscow neigh
-borhoods hold up to 5,000 to 7,000 
meetings.
9 As of February 2018, 
3,450 polls had been conducted us
-ing a centralized Oracle database, 
with 92 million votes cast on diverse 

subjects such as what color the seats 

in a new sports arena should be, 
whether to install driveway access 
gates in neighborhood yards, and 

whether to hire a new doorkeeper.
